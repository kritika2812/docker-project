# docker-project
Prerequisites:
- Setup with Ubuntu 18.04
- Docker Compose installed.
When you run docker-compose up for the first time, it will download all of the necessary Docker images, which might take a while. Once the  images are downloaded and stored in your local machine, Compose will create your containers. The -d flag daemonizes the process, running your containers in the background.
$docker-compose up -d

use the following command to list all of the running containers:

$docker ps
